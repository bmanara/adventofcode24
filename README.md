## bmanara's Attempt @ AOC_24 after taking CSS3230

Below is a snapshot + comments of every day I have attempted. Note that I am NOT going for leaderboards, therefore I am behind. 
***I also blame NS reservist for causing me to miss a whole week :(***

### Checklist
- [x] Day 1
  - [x] 1-1: Simple warmup
  - [x] 1-2: Naive solution. O(n^2)
- [x] Day 2
  - [x] 2-1: Actually took awhile to solve...
  - [ ] 2-2: Not done yet.
- [x] Day 3
  - [x] 3-1: Scan through, use regex.
  - [x] 3-2: Again, usage of regex. Enable or disable whenever needed
- [x] Day 4
  - [x] 4-1: Took awhile to figure out verification method. 
  - [x] 4-2: Easier then part one. Both have no "greedy choice" it seems...
- [x] Day 5 
  - [x] 5-1: Relatively hard. Got it in the end though
  - [ ] 5-2: Not done yet.
- [x] Day 6
  - [x] 6-1: Pretty fun! Managed to get it in the end.
  - [ ] 6-2: Not done yet. This actually seems pretty hard.
- [x] Day 7
  - [x] 7-1: Really easy. Just "brute force" and check all possible permutations. (Terminate early whenever needed)
  - [x] 7-2: Same as part two, just an additional concat operation to consider. Runtime is slow though.
- [ ] Day 8 (Will need a hint for this, not sure how to approach)
  - [ ] 8-1: Not done yet.
  - [ ] 8-2: Not done yet.
- [x] Day 9
  - [x] 9-1: This oddly took awhile, original solution did not work... So I had to do it this way...
  - [ ] 9-2: Not done yet.
- [x] Day 10
  - [x] 10-1: Took awhile to code it out. Easy in theory, harder to implement
  - [ ] 10-2: Not done yet. Should be easy but somehow struggling...
- [ ] Day 11
- [ ] Day 12
- [ ] Day 13
- [ ] Day 14
- [ ] Day 15
- [ ] Day 16
- [ ] Day 17
- [ ] Day 18
- [ ] Day 19
- [ ] Day 20
- [ ] Day 21
